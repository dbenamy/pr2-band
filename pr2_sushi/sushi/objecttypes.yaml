# All object use the TODO hand rule, like the map frame.
# If the object is in the position it would be in when set and you're looking
# from the seat near the setting, positive x is to the right, positive y is
# "forward", and positive z is up.
# A roll of 0 means point along -z (down). TODO check
# A pitch of 0 means point along -z (down). TODO check
# A yaw of 0 means point along +x. TODO check

# With a grasp pose, roll and pitch are the orientation that the gripper tip
# should point to. Yaw is trickier. We'll define it so a yaw of 0 is the
# orientation that the thumb of the gripper should point to.

# Grasp poses don't describe enough to know how to grasp. We don't know what the
# wrist orientation should be. Grasp surfaces should solve this. The first 2
# points of a grasp surface describe the line that the gripper should surround.

# BOWL_1's origin is middle of the bottom of the bowl where it rests on a
# surface.
